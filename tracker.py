# You are building a simple activity tracker for a travel blog.Each time a traveler visits a place,
# the system stores the city name, a visit comment, and the visit date in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

# Your task is to:
# Create a module called tracker.py that contains a function to return a travel record (as a dictionary).
# In the main file, use the function to create a list of at least 3 travel records.
# Convert the date string of each record into a readable format like "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "June 05, 2022").
# Convert the list of records into a JSON string and print it.
# Parse the JSON back to a Python object and display each record on a separate line.

def travel_record(city, comment, date):
    return {
        "city" : city,
        "comment" : comment,
        "date" : date
    }
